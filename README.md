# Numerical Analysis :math:

My numerical analysis class at Penn State Behrend

The professor was one of the best professors I've ever had, but he only taught for one year.

There were two offerings of this course that contributed to my BS minors in Math and Computer Science.
- [Numerical Analysis 1 - CMPSC 455 / MATH 455 ](./src/CMPSC_455/)
  - [Lab 1](./src/CMPSC_455/Lab1.m)
  - [Lab 2](./src/CMPSC_455/Lab2.m)
  - [Lab 3](./src/CMPSC_455/Lab3.m)
  - [Lab 4](./src/CMPSC_455/Lab4.m)
  - [Lab 5](./src/CMPSC_455/Lab5.m)
- [Numerical Analysis 2 - CMPSC 456 / MATH 456 ](./src/CMPSC_455/)
